# Mechuilibria
Simulating simple mechanical structures in Python.

Play with masses, springs, forces; build and demolish structures, or even create mechanical computers! (I don't know if it runs Doom yet.)

A fun physics sandbox as much as it is an educational tool.

## How to Use

Mechuilibria only requires tkinter, the standard Python interface toolkit. Simply run the script.

### Controls

- Arrow keys move the camera, Left Shift and Left Control zoom in or out.

 - Resume or pause the simulation with the "Pause/Resume" button on the left side of the canvas. The simulation starts paused by default, so you need to hit it if you want
physics to happen.

 - There are various operations you can perform with the mouse. Select operation mode from right-side menu and read instructions at the bottom right of the screen.

 - To create point masses or links, you need to set some parameters. Use the input fields below the visualizing canvas for that.

 - Toggle labels using the checkboxes and radio buttons on the left-side menu.
